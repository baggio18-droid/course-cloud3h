In Today's class, we were asked to do personal studies. I have started to work on the quiz that was given last week, which consist of deploying an application to the cloud.
To deploy an application:
1. Open the Applications page in the Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension Administration Console and click Deploy New. The Deploy Application page appears.
2. Enter a name for the application you are deploying, and then click Choose File to search your local file steam for the application archive to be deployed. 
After locating the archive, click OK.Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension Control uploads and deploys the selected WAR (Web Application Archive) file or 
EAR (Enterprise Archive) file.

Once deployed, each application undergoes a series of security checks before it is actually deployed. These checks include a virus scan and a whitelist validation. 
When deployment is successful, the application appears on the list of applications with a Status of Active.
