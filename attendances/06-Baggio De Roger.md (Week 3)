In today's class, we discussed about Oracle Could Infrastructure Compute which is a web service that provides bare metal and virtual machine (VM) compute capacity that delivers 
performance, flexibility, and control without compromise. It's powered by Oracleâ€™s next generation internet-scale infrastructure service and is designed to help modern enterprises 
do more while paying less when developing and running their most demanding applications and workloads in the cloud.
Compute enables you to provision compute capacity in minutes through an easy-to-use web console. The bare metal compute instance, once provisioned, 
provides you access to the host. This gives you the flexibility, control, and performance without compromise needed for your most demanding applications and workloads, 
all while paying only for what you use.
We have also talked about the instance types:
. Bare metal instances are on-demand, bare metal compute resources in the cloud. Unlike virtual machine (VM) instances, bare metal instances are entire physical 
hosts dedicated to a single customer's use with no hypervisor or Oracle applied software installed. You have full control of the bare metal host's resources, 
which gives you flexibility, control, and performance without compromise.
. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute VMs offer smaller compute shapes than bare metal instances. VMs use the same cloud-optimized hardware and networking infrastructure 
as bare metal instances to deliver compute shape flexibility and performance for your changing application needs.
