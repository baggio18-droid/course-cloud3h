Today, Docker, and its open-source father now named Moby, is bigger than ever. According to Docker, over 3.5 million applications have been placed in containers using 
Docker technology and over 37 billion containerized applications have been downloaded.
Docker enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, which can run virtually anywhere. 
As Bottomley told me, "Containers gives you instant application portabil." In addition, Docker containers are easy to deploy in a cloud. As Ben Lloyd Pearson wrote in Opensource.com: "Docker has been designed in a way that it can be incorporated into most DevOps applications, 
including Puppet, Chef, Vagrant, and Ansible, or it can be used on its own to manage development environments."
It can get more applications running on the same hardware than other technologies; it makes it easy for developers to quickly create ready-to-run containered applications; and it makes managing and deploying applications much easier.
